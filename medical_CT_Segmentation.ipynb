        "*   Five lung segmentation files (`lung_middle_lobe_right.nii.gz`, `lung_upper_lobe_left.nii.gz`, `lung_lower_lobe_left.nii.gz`, `lung_lower_lobe_right.nii.gz`, and `lung_upper_lobe_right.nii.gz`) were identified in the `/content/s0011_seg` directory.\n",
        "*   Corresponding ground truth files were found for all identified predicted lung segmentation files in the `/content/s0011/segmentations` directory.\n",
        "*   Evaluation metrics (Dice Score, IoU, Volumetric Similarity) were successfully calculated for each individual lung label.\n",
        "*   The shapes of the predicted and ground truth data matched for all processed lung segmentation files.\n",
        "*   3D mesh data was successfully generated for each lung label using the marching cubes algorithm, and vertices were transformed using the affine matrix.\n",
        "*   An interactive Dash application was built to visualize the 3D lung segmentations, featuring individual opacity sliders for each lung label and displaying the calculated evaluation metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The calculated metrics provide a quantitative measure of the agreement between the predicted and ground truth segmentations for each lung lobe, which can be used to assess the performance of the segmentation model.\n",
        "*   The interactive visualization allows for a qualitative assessment of the segmentation results and provides a tool to visually inspect areas of potential disagreement between the predicted and ground truth segmentations by adjusting the opacity of individual lobes.\n"
